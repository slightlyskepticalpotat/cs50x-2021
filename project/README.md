snakewhisper is a simple [end-to-end encrypted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption) chat program written in Python. It's functional (it currently supports two-way communication with elliptic curve key exchange), but snakewhisper is primarily a proof-of-concept that showcases how regular computer users can easily access—or even create—chat programs with end-to-end encryption.

## Cryptography
Every time snakewhisper starts, it generates an elliptic curve private key using [Curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519) (offering 128 bits of NSA-free security). When it connects to a peer, they exchange public keys and use [Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman) to agree on a shared secret key. After that, the unsalted secret key is passed through [HKDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKDF) to obtain a 128-bit encryption key.

For ease of implementation, snakewhisper encrypts messages using the [Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/) encryption scheme from the [cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) Python package. Fernet is just [AES-128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) with a [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hash-based message authentication code under the hood, and the full specification can be viewed [here](https://github.com/fernet/spec/blob/master/Spec.md). Fernet also includes a timestamp, but it is in cleartext and can be spoofed.

I am confident that the encryption scheme is secure in theory (barring any secret algorithm backdoors) because it is based on well-known cryptographic algorithms and primitives, but less confident that I've implemented everything correctly. Please review the code beforehand if you intend on sending sensitive data with this (at your own risk, of course).

## To-do List
- Support for timestamps
- Support for sending files
- Multi-user conversations
